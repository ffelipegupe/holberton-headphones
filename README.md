# Implement a design from scratch

In this project, I implemented from scratch, without any library, a web page. I used all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I've learned previously.

I didnâ€™t have a lot of instruction, I was free to implement it the way that I wanted - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

*This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.*

Here the final result:
